# SwissStyleProject


A Swiss furniture company called ‘Swiss Style’ wants a new brand and a sleek, minimalist website design for their online store. The page needs to be clean & modern to showcase the products to their customers. Take inspiration from swiss design to build a strong and simple brand. Make sure to include lots of space and padding to present each product individually with a price and a short description. The page needs to be easy to navigate and consistent with typeface choice and colours.
